To-Do List Application

📌 Project Description

The To-Do List Application is Task 1 of the CodSoft Python Internship. It is a simple yet powerful command-line program developed in Python that enables users to efficiently manage their daily tasks by allowing them to add, view, update, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in a tasks.json file, ensuring that the data is saved even after the program is closed. This project helps users stay organized by keeping track of their tasks in a structured manner.

🚀 Features

✅ Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.

📜 View Tasks: Displays the list of all stored tasks.

✏️ Update Tasks: Modify existing tasks as needed.

❌ Delete Tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.

💾 Persistent Storage: Saves tasks in a JSON file to retain data even after exiting the program.

🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is built using Python and utilizes the following libraries:

JSON Module: Used to store and retrieve tasks from a file (tasks.json) to ensure persistence.

File Handling: Read and write data to tasks.json to keep task records saved.

User Input Handling: Allows users to interact with the application via a command-line interface.

Basic Python Functions & Loops: Manages task operations like add, view, update, and delete.


🖩 Simple Calculator - CodSoft Internship (Task 2)
This is a Simple Calculator developed in Python as part of my CodSoft Internship - Task 2.
The program performs basic arithmetic operations and allows users to continuously perform calculations using a looping mechanism.

🔹 Features:
✅ Basic Arithmetic Operations – Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/)
✅ Looping Mechanism – The calculator runs continuously until the user chooses to exit
✅ Error Handling – Prevents errors such as division by zero and invalid inputs
✅ Step-by-Step Calculation Display – Shows a clear breakdown of the operation performed
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Simple input and output format for easy usage

🛠️ What I Implemented in the Code:
1️⃣ User Input Handling:

The program asks the user to enter two numbers.
If the user enters a non-numeric value, the program detects it and asks for valid input.
2️⃣ Operation Selection:

The user is provided with four options:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
The program reads the user’s choice and performs the corresponding operation.
3️⃣ Error Handling (Exception Handling):

Invalid Operation Handling: If the user enters an invalid operation choice, the program asks them to select again.
Division by Zero Prevention: If the user tries to divide by zero, the program displays an error and asks for a valid number.
Non-Numeric Input Handling: If the user enters a string instead of a number, the program catches the error and asks for a correct input.
4️⃣ Loop for Continuous Execution:

After performing a calculation, the program asks the user if they want to perform another calculation.
If the user enters "yes", the calculator restarts.
If the user enters "no", the program exits with a thank-you message.
5️⃣ Step-by-Step Output Display:

The program clearly displays the operation, numbers used, and the final result in an easy-to-read format.
