To-Do List Application

📌 Project Description

The To-Do List Application is Task 1 of the CodSoft Python Internship. It is a simple yet powerful command-line program developed in Python that enables users to efficiently manage their daily tasks by allowing them to add, view, update, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in a tasks.json file, ensuring that the data is saved even after the program is closed. This project helps users stay organized by keeping track of their tasks in a structured manner.

🚀 Features

✅ Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.

📜 View Tasks: Displays the list of all stored tasks.

✏️ Update Tasks: Modify existing tasks as needed.

❌ Delete Tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.

💾 Persistent Storage: Saves tasks in a JSON file to retain data even after exiting the program.

🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is built using Python and utilizes the following libraries:


🚀 Task 3 Completed | Contact Management System | #CodSoft Internship

I'm excited to share that I have successfully completed Task 3 as part of my CodSoft internship! 🎉

I built a Contact Management System in Python, which allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete contacts efficiently. This project helped me enhance my skills in file handling, data management, and user interaction design.

🔹 Features Implemented:
✔️ Add new contacts with name, phone, email, and address
✔️ View the complete contact list
✔️ Search contacts by name or phone number
✔️ Update existing contact details
✔️ Delete contacts securely
✔️ Persistent storage using JSON for data management

🔹 Technologies Used:
🔹 Python - Core programming language
🔹 JSON - For storing contact data persistently
🔹 File Handling - Read & write data efficiently
🔹 CLI-based UI - Simple and interactive user interface

This project was a great learning experience, strengthening my understanding of CRUD operations, data structures, and user-friendly application development. Looking forward to the next challenge! 🚀

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback! 💬


JSON Module: Used to store and retrieve tasks from a file (tasks.json) to ensure persistence.

File Handling: Read and write data to tasks.json to keep task records saved.

User Input Handling: Allows users to interact with the application via a command-line interface.

Basic Python Functions & Loops: Manages task operations like add, view, update, and delete.


🖩 Simple Calculator - CodSoft Internship (Task 2)
This is a Simple Calculator developed in Python as part of my CodSoft Internship - Task 2.
The program performs basic arithmetic operations and allows users to continuously perform calculations using a looping mechanism.

🔹 Features:
✅ Basic Arithmetic Operations – Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/)
✅ Looping Mechanism – The calculator runs continuously until the user chooses to exit
✅ Error Handling – Prevents errors such as division by zero and invalid inputs
✅ Step-by-Step Calculation Display – Shows a clear breakdown of the operation performed
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Simple input and output format for easy usage

🛠️ What I Implemented in the Code:
1️⃣ User Input Handling:

The program asks the user to enter two numbers.
If the user enters a non-numeric value, the program detects it and asks for valid input.
2️⃣ Operation Selection:

The user is provided with four options:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
The program reads the user’s choice and performs the corresponding operation.
3️⃣ Error Handling (Exception Handling):

Invalid Operation Handling: If the user enters an invalid operation choice, the program asks them to select again.
Division by Zero Prevention: If the user tries to divide by zero, the program displays an error and asks for a valid number.
Non-Numeric Input Handling: If the user enters a string instead of a number, the program catches the error and asks for a correct input.
4️⃣ Loop for Continuous Execution:

After performing a calculation, the program asks the user if they want to perform another calculation.
If the user enters "yes", the calculator restarts.
If the user enters "no", the program exits with a thank-you message.
5️⃣ Step-by-Step Output Display:

The program clearly displays the operation, numbers used, and the final result in an easy-to-read format.
